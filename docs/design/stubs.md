# The stub inventory

**Doctrine** (geology.md § Expression of the ledger + § Genesis addendum,
DECIDED 2026-07-21, user): *a stub is a candidate to be subsumed into a spine,
system, or process — the expresser.* Stubs are permanently legitimate in
exactly one place: **genesis**. Everywhere else a stub must be known, loud,
and listed here with its heir. **An unlisted stub is a defect in this
inventory, not a licence.**

Each entry names: what the rule fakes · the expresser that subsumes it ·
loudness at audit time · blast radius. First audit 2026-07-21 (read-only
sweep, background agent; integrator-curated). Update this file in the same
commit as any change that adds, removes, or subsumes a stub.

## Active stubs

### 1. ruin-posts — **was UNDOCUMENTED until this audit**
`collapse.rs::ruin_posts` (~997), rendered ~400.
An abandoned pregen site expresses as ≤10 procedurally-scattered wood posts,
2–4 voxels tall, at hashed angle/radius. The *abandonment fact* is genuine
committed history; the *structure* is a rule-of-thumb. **Heir (user, 2026-07-21):** the social sim +
ecology — dwarf-fortress-class civilization history; "that's the only way a
post gets there." Culture-related artifacts are placeholder as a class: do not
bandaid, do not think about, until ecology is done and the social sim gets its
design pass (the big one: NPCs and all — priors exist in the corpus). **Blast:**
the only world-visible form of settlement history. *Loud code marker added
2026-07-21.*

### 2. surface-veneer-block-rule
`collapse.rs::surface_sample` (~516): Grass/Dirt/Stone from year-zero climate,
hard thresholds (`precip < 0.10`, lapse-rate `t < −4 °C`), no slope, no record
consult. The cause of the razor-straight grass/dirt frontier. **Heir:** the
ecology system — vegetation-as-deep-time, placement by fitness (ecology.md
DECIDED 2026-07-21). **DO NOT BANDAID.** **Blast:** every surface block in the
world, out to the far horizon (`coarse_surface` shares the rule).

**SHARPENED 2026-07-21 (user, forms pass):** the veneer's *grass* half now has
an explicit disposition — **grass is suspended and must not be expressed at
all**. It is an ecology state riding on the substrate materials of a block or
its loose eighths, not a block identity chosen by a threshold. The forms slices
express the materials the sim says are present and paint no grass; the user
pre-ratified the appearance ("it'll be a mostly brown world for a bit"). So the
retirement of this stub is now *partly a deletion* rather than wholly a
replacement: the Grass branch goes away with ecology rather than being
reimplemented by it. Turf's eventual presentation is sketched (ligatures +
anisotropic variants — green on top faces, roots-texture additive on sides,
over a seeded dirt material in loose eighths or packed pores) and explicitly
**not to be built now**. Non-grasslike ground cover: suspended entirely.
See materials.md § "The forms design pass".

### 3. soil-depth-from-precip / the discarded `H` plane — **RETIRED 2026-07-21 (journal/0053)**
*Was:* soil depth = 3/2/1 voxels by present-day precip (`collapse.rs::column`)
and a clastic veneer budget of `1.0 + precip*2.5` (`clastic_pass`), while the
deep sim's regolith plane `H` was summed away by `field.rs` (`surf = r + h`).

*Now:* `DeepField` carries `regolith` (the `H` plane, +2.27 MB at Medium,
+1.5 % of the field). **Both** consumers read it — the legacy soil band and the
clastic veneer budget — so the heir landed whole; neither half remains. Rule:
round `H` to the nearest whole voxel, clamp `0..=8`; **0 is reachable**, which
is what the old floor of 1 made impossible. Two findings from the slice worth
carrying forward:

- **`Σ(recorded unit thicknesses) ≡ H` exactly.** The strata record *is* the
  regolith column, decomposed. So the veneer's honest budget is the part of the
  column whole voxels cannot resolve (`round(H/0.9)` minus what
  `deposit_deep_history` expressed), amalgamated as one surficial body —
  bioturbation, physically. The fill is now mass-conserving against the ledger.
- **The border wilds keep the precip rule**, explicitly scoped to genesis (there
  is no deep-time run out there to consult). That is the § Genesis case, not a
  surviving stub.

*Residual:* the 8-voxel veneer cap truncates the ledger on 14.3 % of land. That
is **stub 12**, below — a different defect, uncovered by this one.

### 4. exhum / t_crust — the absent metamorphic expresser
`field.rs` (~164): shipped, documented in-code as "the metamorphic-grade axes
the collapse tier reads" — **and nothing reads them** (the comment overstates;
noted here so it isn't trusted). **Heir:** a metamorphism pass reading the
P/T path into grade classes (schist/slate/gneiss roster, geology.md).
**Blast:** zero today; lands the day a cut face should show an aureole and
shows plain basement. *Only populated in tectonic-history worlds (U8 gates
the payoff).*

### 5. igneous-emplacement-depth-constants — *omitted from the decision's holdout list; added by this audit*
`geology.rs` (~237): `INTRUSIVE_DEPTH_M = 250`, extrusive `5.0`,
`INTRUSIVE_TOP_VOX = 96` — one number where a per-column burial story belongs.
**Heir:** the paleo-context provider (igneous fitness consumes tectonic
setting + real emplacement depth; geology.md § formation context).
**Blast:** intrusive/extrusive member choice + basement thickness in every
Orogeny/Arc/Rift column.

### 6. paleo-temperature-is-present-day-latitude — *omitted from the holdout list; added by this audit*
`geology.rs::deposit_deep_history` (~379): a deep unit's at-deposition
temperature = today's column temperature (the aridity axis correctly reads the
recorder's tag; temperature does not). **Heir:** a paleo-temperature curve in
the deep record (the "later 3e slice"). **Blast:** temp-sensitive member
fitness inside deep strata.

### 7. s10-community-vector — biology with no vegetation
`deeptime/biotic.rs`: coal/peat/paleosol/charcoal from a community scalar;
fire burns a number, not a forest. **Heir:** ecology-pass vegetation members
with proliferation patterns, consumed by the same mechanisms (ecology.md Note
2026-07-21). **Blast:** the geography of all organic facies.

### 8. uniform-parent-material-phosphorus
`deeptime/biotic.rs` (initial P pool): every cell starts with the same P —
granite and basalt pretended equal. Documented only in S10-results (§ design
choice 12); no live code marker. **Heir:** P keyed on provenance. **Blast:**
retrogression/paleosol geography (currently player-invisible behind stub 2).

### 9. paleo-sea-level-sinusoid
`deeptime/grid.rs::sea_level_at`: one deterministic sinusoid (amp 35 m,
period 50) stands in for epoch-indexed sea-level/climate history; drives every
unit's subsea/subaerial tag. **Heir:** epoch-indexed pregen curves
(earth-processes § 6). **Blast:** the marine/terrestrial split of the entire
deep record — large, but *inside* the ledger (it is history the runtime then
faithfully expresses).

### 10. frontier-pressure closed-form
`dc-sim/statistical/world.rs::prior_pressure_weights` (~280): frontier
boundary conditions from a closed-form of danger, self-described stand-in.
**Heir:** the statistical tier's real cached summaries (S2). **Blast:** low,
indirect (edge-region history synthesis).

### 11. placer-presence-is-source-blind — *added 2026-07-21 by the ores design pass*
`geology.rs` placer pass: gold-dust *presence* in a river is a function of
discharge + settle energy only — every big-enough river carries some. The
energy zonation (where in the gravel it concentrates) is real S8 mechanism;
the presence term is a field-blind constant. **Heir:** condition
presence/abundance on the upstream catchment's lode endowment (drainage
export × the R1 lode field — ores.md R2-B). **Blast:** rivers don't
differentiate; the "read the river, walk upstream" chain dead-ends.

### 12. the sub-voxel bed sieve eats three-quarters of the sediment pile — *added 2026-07-21 by journal/0053*
`geology.rs::deposit_deep_history` (~375) rounds each recorded deep unit to whole
voxels and **drops anything under half a voxel**. Measured on the production
Medium world: mean `H` per subaerial cell is **4.75 m**, of which only **~1.15 m**
survives as whole-voxel strata. The dune-field station records 379 units summing
to 7.99 m and expresses **zero**. journal/0053 stops the loss being a *deletion*
— the residue is amalgamated into the surficial veneer, so mass is conserved —
but it is conserved as one homogenized body, and the veneer's 8-voxel cap
truncates even that on **14.3 % of land**. **Heir:** amalgamate adjacent
sub-voxel units *inside the record* into composite units (preserving
stratigraphic order and letting a composite carry its constituents as
inclusions/partials), which is the forms pass's business, not the veneer's.
Uncapping the veneer without that is not an option — it would grow a 54 m
single-member band at the loess margin. **Blast:** the legibility of every
laminated section in the world, and the honesty of the loose-column mass budget
in thick basins.

## Sibling gap (not a substitution — an unexpressed ledger term)

- **Layer-cake strata / no dip-fold.** Tectonic history is recorded; structural
  deformation of the record (earth-processes § 7) is unbuilt except the
  `unconformity` flag. Every stratum lies horizontal regardless of history.
  Same family as stub 4: the ledger holds what the runtime does not yet say.

## Genesis (permanently legitimate — affirmed, not defects)

Level-0 lattice corners (`corner0`) · border-wilds cell synthesis · initial
bedrock + plate seeding (`tectonics.rs`, `build_cells`) · `SEA_LEVEL_M = 0`
datum · pregen `Provenance` assignment.

## Audited and rejected (real mechanisms or ratified decisions, not stubs)

Legacy S1 terrain keys 3/4 (ratified dev affordance; journal/0017 verified
contained) · dormant erosion-agent axes ("not a placeholder" by construction)
· erodibility/placer/inclusion calibration knobs (tuning of real mechanisms)
· `DEEP_MAX_WIDTH` Large-extent coarsening (coarsen-the-cause, sanctioned) ·
`record_at_voxel` nearest-cell sampling (flagged, legitimate) · 12 fps stepped
animation + parametric crouch (ratified aesthetic/firewall) · placeholder
texture packs + vertex-color albedo (rendering-asset placeholders — heir is
authored art, outside this doctrine's scope; visuals.md owns the path).
