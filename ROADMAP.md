# Roadmap

The living sequence — the only non-append-only document besides code. Update
in the same commit as any journal entry: finished work moves to **Shipped**;
walk/field findings land in **Observed** first (the walk reports, the
diagnosis measures); only diagnosed work gets **Sequenced**.

## Shipped

- 2026-07-18 — Repo, architecture, CI (3-OS), five-crate workspace.
- 2026-07-18 — S1 voxel scale (N=2 decided) · S2 constraint ledger (GO) ·
  S3 chunk format v1 + LOD + far mesh · S4 Forward+ + shader packs ·
  S5 dc-api parity (wasm/MCP/native) · S7 worldgen pregen + lazy pyramid +
  year-zero handoff · S8 materials storage (GO, free-form mixtures).
- 2026-07-18 — Rendering fixes from walk 2: spawn-frame flash, LOD z-fight.

## In flight

- S6 physics bubble (rapier3d, dc-physics crate, client G-key demo).

## Sequenced

1. **Client through dc-api + observability harness** (queued behind S6):
   player input as commands against a hosted world; in-client MCP surface;
   screenshot capture to journal/assets; agent self-walk practice
   (orogeny's 0033 pattern).
2. Character MCP surface (`dc-mcp-character`): grant-scoped embodied agent
   play — same generator as dc-mcp-dev, different grants.
3. Geology deep-dive (design conversation → docs/design/geology.md; mine
   orogeny's stratigraphy-v1 ideas — in-progress source, not a spec).
4. Biomes-as-diagnosis design (consumers of climate/substrate/disturbance
   axes; registry-defined).
5. Ecology design (succession as derived-from-disturbance state; populations
   as statistical-tier distributions).

## Observed (undiagnosed or deliberately unfixed)

- ~2/3 of far-mesh triangles are sealed cave surfaces (S3) — column-summary
  skip estimated 3–5×; far field should become summary-shaped (adaptive
  volume), not spherical.
- Far meshing is main-thread, budgeted (S1/S3) — wants async tasks.
- Rivers are straight cell-chords (S7); course refinement needs the 2-ring
  argument re-proved at finer levels.
- Terrain amplitude conservative — no voxel-scale cliffs (S7).
- Site cap 240 (u8 RegionId) — concrete instance of S2's ledger-scale
  question (S7).
- Sparse sidecar encoding for thin debris drapes (S8) — index array dominates.
- Seed-stable worlds across releases: versioning policy undecided (S7).
- HDR/exposure: v0 post grades LDR; sky-as-pass needs hook format 1 (S4).
- S2 checkpoint facts (deep-time re-derivation cost) — design owed before
  ledgers densify.
