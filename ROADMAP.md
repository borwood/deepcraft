# Roadmap

The living sequence — the only non-append-only document besides code. Update
in the same commit as any journal entry: finished work moves to **Shipped**;
walk/field findings land in **Observed** first (the walk reports, the
diagnosis measures); only diagnosed work gets **Sequenced**.

## Shipped

- 2026-07-20 — **Organic materials + the biotic production flip** (journal/0026,
  background agent, worktree branch for the integrator; gates green —
  fmt/clippy/test all `--release`, 40 suites 0 failed). **The flip is live**:
  `production_config`'s `biotic` is ON, so every new world runs the S10 ecology
  and its `DeepField` carries organic facies. And the S10 gap is closed —
  `geology.rs::deep_class` now **consults the `Biofacies` axis first and lets it
  win where inhabited**, so an organic unit resolves to an organic content class
  instead of collapsing as whatever the transporting flow was doing. The measured
  seam argues for "wins" over "blends": the 24 m seam at world voxel
  (107338, 58787) is tagged `Sa/A/L` — subaerial, **arid**, **low** energy — which
  the old rule sent to clastic-fine, i.e. mudstone (coal swamps sit where
  drainage collects, not where rain falls; S10 design choice 8). **What a player
  can now dig**: that column reads 3 vox mudstone / 8 vox sandstone+conglomerate /
  **27 vox coal** / 7 vox conglomerate / **2 vox coal** / marine mudstone below —
  `Block::Coal` and `MaterialId::COAL` in the voxel contents, and coal's smash
  resistance is 2.2 against granite's 5.5 (real property sheet), so it yields to
  a tool that would barely scratch the cap. **Three materials added**, each a
  new class filled by one vanilla member (classes-as-contracts, so a pack
  diversifies without moving a seam): `dc:stratum/organic-coal` → coal,
  `dc:stratum/organic-peat` → peat, `dc:stratum/organic-soil` → carbonaceous
  mudstone (fills both `Soil` and `Retro`). **Three deliberately NOT added, on
  measurement**: a whole-grid census of what survives the 0.9 m voxel decided the
  roster — coal 89.6 % of units survive, Soil 48.5 %, Retro 6 % of units but 56 %
  of thickness, Peat 2.3 % (72 units world-wide — rare because thick *and*
  unburied is the definition of not-yet-coal), and **Charcoal 0 of 158 310**
  (mean bed ~3.5 cm against a 90 cm voxel). So **no charcoal material** — a
  charcoal band cannot exist in a voxel column and the material would be dead
  content; the honest form is an inclusion (pore/debris eighths, the placer
  pattern), filed to Sequenced with the measurement. **No coal rank ladder** —
  lignite→anthracite is a real burial-depth progression but the transitions live
  at 1–2 km and our deepest overburden is ~100 m, so a rank window would be
  decoration on an axis the data never visits; the class documents that its
  **depth axis is the rank axis** for the day the record carries kilometres.
  **No distinct retrogressive material** — retrogression is a phosphorus fact
  about a community, and the property sheet has no nutrient axis. Invariants
  intact: class-share unchanged (tested with a second coal member),
  registration-order independence re-proven roster-agnostically, determinism
  untouched. **Ritual measured 13.79 s** with biology on — see **corrections
  #12**: the ratified 25 s was the spike harness's *scalar* path; production takes
  S9b's byte-identical *parallel* path, so biology's real marginal cost is
  **+2.6 s**, not +10 s. Test-suite 381.9 s → 503 s (+121 s, of which ~106 s is
  the flip itself putting a ~14 s ritual behind every world-level suite and ~15 s
  is the new proof); no `--ignored` gating used. **NEEDS RATIFICATION**
  (appearance): three new rock colours enter cut faces, and carbonaceous mudstone
  is now the second most abundant facies in the world (185 km of surviving
  thickness) — the user should eyeball a cut face before this is settled. Files:
  `materials/mod.rs`, `materials/geology.rs`, `voxel.rs`, `worldgen/geology.rs`
  (the routing), `pipeline.rs`, `collapse.rs`, `deeptime/field.rs` (the flip),
  `dc-api/host.rs`, `meshing.rs`/`terrain_material.rs`/`terrain_fullbright.wgsl`
  (atlas 26 → 29), `gen_placeholder_textures.py` + 3 packs, `tests/organic.rs` +
  `examples/organic_probe.rs` (new).
  **PHOTOGRAPHED 2026-07-20 (journal/0027, photo walk, no code changed)** — the
  appearance question above now has images. Two of three read fine, one does not.
  **Carbonaceous mudstone reads well**: an ordinary 988 m hillside cut
  (`0027-carbonaceous-mudstone-ordinary-lit.png`) puts 3 voxels of it as the
  thickest unit in the soil profile, and it is a distinct chocolate brown against
  mudstone's red-brown and basalt's blue-black — the profile is *more* legible,
  not less. **Coal renders as pure black** with zero legibility, including on a
  fully sunlit up-facing bench floor (`0027-coal-seam-cut-lit.png`) — filed to
  Observed; the fullbright control proves the data is fine. **The world is not
  darker** (`0027-vista-lit.png`): nothing organic reaches the surface, so a wide
  view is unchanged green. **Peat was found** despite 0026's expectation —
  world voxel (-22983, 24546) on the client's seed carries 16 voxels of peat over
  1 of coal over carbonaceous mudstone, all three new materials in one section
  (`0027-peat-coal-mudstone-section-lit.png`). Note the sites are re-derived on
  **seed 1337** — see the Observed item on the client's fixed seed.

- 2026-07-20 — **S10 — the biotic layer on the deep-time A-tier** (journal/0025,
  docs/spikes/S10-results.md; background agent, worktree branch for the
  integrator; gates green — fmt/clippy/test all `--release`, 39 suites 0 failed).
  ecology.md § 3's **community vector + the six processes** implemented on the
  3e-1 A tier, additive in dc-worldgen and **off by default**
  (`DeepConfig::biotic`; with it off every path is byte-identical to pre-S10 —
  the modifier planes stay empty and read their identity values, and every unit
  tags `Biofacies::Mineral`). All six processes are real, none stubbed:
  suitability (`min` over tolerances — Liebig), dispersal (bounded neighbour
  kernel), competition (finite capacity, incumbency-weighted), nutrient cycling
  (the Walker & Syers curve **emerges**), niche construction, disturbance (fire
  real, flood a succession reset whose signature is the mineral overbank band
  erosion already writes). The **lagged coupling** ecology.md mandates is the run
  loop: `erosion.step` consumes last epoch's biotic modifiers, then `biotic.step`
  reads the fresh terrain and writes the next epoch's — which is what keeps the
  biology↔erosion cycle out of the pass graph. No new pregen pass: biology rides
  inside `dc:pass/deep-time` (already the creator of `DeepStrata`, already read by
  `dc:pass/clastic-deposition`), so registration-order independence is inherited.
  **All four target signals present and legible** (A tier, seed `0x0D5E_ED57_2026`):
  **coal** 1 133 cols / thickest seam **24.03 m**; **paleosols** 22.9 % of columns
  (the best is a genuine cyclothem — soils and peats alternating with marine
  bands, each carrying its at-deposition climate tag); **charcoal** 20.2 % (one
  upland column carries 19 fire beds, all arid-tagged); **retrogression** 23.5 %
  (an ancient 1148 m surface, soil at cap, available P 0.0097, rock-P drawn to
  0.44 — a Walker & Syers chronosequence nobody scripted, with the *geography*
  right: erosion rejuvenates slopes and floodplains, only untouched surfaces
  starve). **Cost: the ritual 15.17 s → 25.19 s (1.66×), and the world KEEPS only
  +6 MiB** — the +68.6 MiB peak is transient working set dropped when the run
  ends. The curve is **linear in cells** and the ratio *falls* as grids grow
  (1.80 → 1.66): the biotic step is a flat per-cell pass with no heap and no
  global dependency chain, while erosion carries the flood's `n log n`. Because
  `DEEP_MAX_WIDTH` already caps the deep grid, **+10 s is the same at Large as at
  Medium**. Determinism intact including scalar↔parallel byte-identity; biotic
  carbon is tracked as a genuine external mass input (`Δ(ΣR+ΣH) == uplift +
  biotic`). Two mechanisms worth remembering: **soil is a pedogenic OVERPRINT,
  not a deposited layer** (retag + thicken + merge down — this alone took the
  record from 665 k units back to 71 k, within 0.2 % of the biology-free run),
  and **soil horizons require a depositional hiatus** (correct pedology *and* the
  cost control, the same mechanism). Test-suite delta +16 s; no `--ignored`
  gating needed. **Agent recommendation: GO** — flip `production_config`'s
  `biotic` and sequence the collapse-tier organic materials immediately behind
  it. **The honest gap: the record contains coal, the world does not** — an
  organic unit still collapses as ordinary clastic (`deep_class` reads only
  env/energy, and there is no coal material), so a player cannot yet mine that
  24 m seam. **NEEDS RATIFICATION** (below, § Sequenced). Files: `biotic.rs`
  (new), `recorder.rs` (`Biofacies` + `overprint_top` + signal queries),
  `grid.rs`/`erosion.rs`/`mod.rs` (modifier planes + lagged step order),
  `examples/biotic_spike.rs` + `tests/biotic.rs` (new).

- 2026-07-20 — **Far-seam fix cycle: uniform-per-level depth push** (journal/0024,
  background agent; worktree branch for the integrator; gates green — fmt/clippy/test
  all `--release`; walk-verified lit + fullbright). The anti-z-fight push in
  `farmesh.rs` moved each far tile/chunk along its *own* center→viewer direction,
  so adjacent same-level tiles shifted along slightly different directions and
  reopened the (mesh-space-watertight) shared edge as a 0.08–0.9 m world-space slot
  — a see-through bright seam once the far field was a hollow top sheet
  (corrections #11). Replaced with **one shared push vector per LOD level per
  frame** along the camera-forward axis (magnitude unchanged, `DEPTH_PUSH_FRAC ×
  coarse voxel`): identical rigid motion for every tile of a level closes
  same-level seams by construction, per-level magnitude still separates overlapping
  rings, and it stays a true world-space depth offset (corrections #1, never a
  bias). Both far paths fixed (S1 `far_transform_translation` + FF2a
  `far_tile_translation`, via a shared `level_depth_push`). Transform-only — one
  shared material / standard `Mesh` untouched, so the FF2a multidraw batching is
  unaffected. **NEEDS RATIFICATION**: none (transform-only; no appearance change
  beyond removing the defect) — **user-confirmed fixed 2026-07-20** ("seam fix
  good"). File: `farmesh.rs` (both translation fns + shared
  push helper + module docs + world-space seam test).

- 2026-07-19 — **FF2a — the voxel-language far field** (journal/0023, background
  agent; worktree branch for the integrator; gates green — fmt/clippy/test all
  `--release`; walk-verified live, RTX 3070 / Vulkan). Replaces journal/0022's
  smooth-TIN far tiles with **voxel-stepped columns** (visuals.md § distance
  speaks the voxel language): each coarse column's summary height is FLOOR-
  quantized to the level's coarse-voxel step, meshed as stepped prisms — greedy-
  merged top faces + exposed side faces between neighbour columns of differing
  height. **Step 0 (empirical, DECIDED-substrate check):** Bevy 0.19's GPU-driven
  multidraw path **engages fully** for our custom `TerrainMaterial` with custom
  vertex attributes — live probe read `mode=Culling`, `Opaque3d batches=74 sets=1`
  (all near + far terrain draws, one shared material, merged into a *single*
  multidraw set); Vulkan backend; custom attributes only choose the allocator
  slab, they don't disqualify batching. Nothing bespoke needed. **Three wins fall
  out of the voxelization:** (a) *near/far parity, no sink* — flooring makes the
  far top ≤ the near surface by construction, so the opaque near terrain wins the
  overlap band and journal/0022's half-voxel sink is deleted; a stride-aligned
  column matches the near voxel top exactly (quantized-exact). (b) *crack class
  cured inherently* — a step's side face is emitted once, by the taller column
  only, and a tile samples its neighbours' shared boundary columns, so same-level
  seams are watertight with no skirt (grazing-angle shot: no pixel cracks);
  ring-to-ring and near/far edges get a modest 2-voxel skirt ("skirt only what
  remains"). (c) *no buried sheet* — far columns the near field covers are CULLED
  (`near_covers`, altitude-aware 3-D distance < 112 m), not lapped underneath, so
  digging never exposes a phantom floor (dig test: only real near geology; a
  fully-covered tile meshes to empty). The per-column payload is an extensible
  `ColumnSpan` (top + block today, persistence-shaped POD, FF2b extends to a span
  stack); the tile mesher is a **pure function** of (spans + coverage mask + ring
  flags) with the impure derivation in the streamer, so filed async far-meshing
  and edit-driven re-derivation stay drop-in (coordinator amendments). Perf:
  ~1.87 ms/tile derive+mesh, budgeted 2 tiles/frame, no hitch; greedy merging
  makes stepped tiles *cheaper* than the smooth sheet (worst-case ~698 vs fixed
  2048 tris/tile). Scale checkpoint (dev measurement, radius unchanged): current
  1.2 km field 188 tiles / ~21.5 MiB; projected ~10 km ≈ 376 tiles / ~43 MiB,
  per-frame meshing stays budget-bounded (~3.7 ms) regardless of radius. Keys 3/4
  keep the untouched S1 far mesh. **RATIFIED 2026-07-20 (user, from the
  0023/0024 images)**: the stepped-horizon look is approved ("fine for now"),
  the 112 m coverage inset is good; the skirt depth (2 coarse voxels) rides
  as-built (no bandaid). Follow-up filed to Sequenced: user wants **knobs to
  adjust the far-field ranges**. Files: `farmesh.rs` (stepped mesher, `ColumnSpan`,
  `quantize_top`, `near_covers`, coverage-refresh streamer), `app.rs`
  (`GpuProbePlugin`, env-gated).

- 2026-07-19 — **The far-field horizon — the worldgen world gets a far field**
  (journal/0022, background agent; merged `--no-ff`, gates re-run green on
  merged main, walk 17 photographs below). Under the worldgen authority
  the far LOD rings drew the legacy S1 terrain (~8 m) while the real world sat
  ~1000 m up: a phantom old world below and — worse — **no horizon at all**
  beyond the load radius (journal/0018 § the empty horizon). Now the far field is
  the authority's **own** surface, sampled coarsely: a new
  `WorldGenerator::coarse_surface` runs the per-column collapse kernel (elevation
  lattice + river carving + surface rule — factored out of `column()` so near and
  far are provably one function) for a single column, O(pyramid depth), memoized,
  **no full-res chunk**. The lattice already folds the deep-time `DeepField`
  surface in at the locale level (journal/0015), and runs into the wilds, so the
  summary needs no second source and never dissolves into empty sky. The far mesh
  is now a **2-D annulus of heightfield tiles** (top surface only, 2048 tris/tile
  vs the old shell's ~⅔-sealed-cave triangles), gated on the active authority:
  key 2 → the worldgen heightfield (`farmesh::stream_far_surface`), keys 3/4 →
  the untouched S1 far mesh. **Near/far boundary height mismatch: 0 voxels** at
  coinciding corners (height is climate-independent, so a far sample equals its
  near column exactly); residual is only the sub-coarse relief dropped between
  corners, dressed by a half-coarse-voxel downward sink + depth push + S4 haze.
  Perf: world-create unchanged (streams post-spawn); derivation **1.377 µs/column
  → a full 1.2 km 4-ring field in ~0.22 s**, budgeted 2 tiles/frame, no hitch.
  Tripwire: the worldgen summary path never touches `TerrainGen` (S1 authority
  returns `None`). **NEEDS RATIFICATION**: none new — the heightfield-vs-shell
  far-field shape follows the journal/0017 summary-pyramid direction the user
  already promoted; the aesthetic sink/push/haze constants ride as-built (no
  bandaid). Files: `collapse.rs` (`coarse_surface`, `surface_sample`),
  `authority.rs` (`far_field_is_worldgen`, `worldgen_coarse_surface` + tripwire),
  `farmesh.rs` (heightfield path), `meshing.rs` (`face_color` opened),
  `app.rs` (wiring).

- 2026-07-19 — **PBR-1: the real material renderer** (journal/0019, merged
  `c49566f`, gates green on merged main; **walk 14 done** — which caught a
  ±Z-face NaN in the shader's tangent frame within three frames, fixed in
  integration, journal/0019 § walk 14). The interim vertex-color dither/mosaic
  (journal/0010) is replaced by a **custom Forward+ LabPBR material**: three
  `texture_2d_array`s (basecolor / normal+AO / specular), layer index = material
  id, blended per fragment by height/AO contrast (heightlerp). **Mixed faces
  return to single quads** — the mosaic's 16× geometry is gone
  (196 608 → 12 288 tris on a fully-mixed 32³ chunk); constituents ride as
  per-vertex splat attributes (`Uint32x4` layers + `Float32x4` weights), top-N
  chosen by the world-anchored hash (the >N path is test-only headroom).
  **Uniform-contents voxels now sample their MATERIAL pack, not their block's**
  — this **kills the walk-10 "member identity is render-invisible" item**
  (siltstone renders differently from mudstone). The atlas is widened past the
  material count with four **block-only** layers (grass/dirt/stone/wood) so a
  *single* material renders the whole lit world — near geology, uniform strata,
  the far LOD rings, and the legacy S1 terrain — with no seam. `--fullbright`
  path unchanged: the same mesh carries both vertex color and splat data, and
  the streamer picks the unlit `StandardMaterial` under the flag — but walk 14
  found mixed-face *appearance* changed (speckle loss, Observed below). Directional sun + hemispherical ambient only (PBR-2 owns shadows,
  point lights, tonemap/HDR, POM, water; never GI). Placeholder packs regenerated
  21 → 26 to cover the full `MaterialId` registry (the 3d roster widening:
  siltstone/conglomerate/diorite/andesite/olivine got packs). **NEEDS
  RATIFICATION**: `SPLAT_N = 4` (the per-face material cap, like 0010's 4×4 dither
  flag) and the sun/hemi-ambient calibration constants (aesthetic, user-owned —
  the walk judges them). Files: `terrain_material.rs`, `shaders/terrain.wgsl`
  (new); `meshing.rs` (splat rewrite); `app.rs`/`streaming.rs`/`farmesh.rs`/
  `authority.rs` (material wiring); `tools/gen_placeholder_textures.py` + the 5
  new packs + manifest.

- 2026-07-19 — S1-fallback sweep (journal/0017, merged `--no-ff` to main,
  gates re-run on merged main by the integrator): closed the defect class
  journal/0016 named. The client now
  has ONE world-answer surface for solidity — `Authority::is_solid_voxel`
  (lazily generating the hosted world, edits included) — and the six near-field
  consumers that answered from the legacy S1 `TerrainGen` on a ChunkMap miss now
  route through it: player collision, character foot-IK grounding, crosshair
  edit raycast, physics collider tiles, and mesh-border culling
  (`streaming.rs` + `remesh_dirty`). Guard: `ChunkMap::is_solid` (the fallback
  method) deleted; the ambient `Terrain` resource deleted (no system can
  `Res<Terrain>` a wrong world); tripwire test
  `empty_cache_solidity_paths_read_the_worldgen_authority` fails on old main and
  catches all six sites; doctrine drafted in ARCHITECTURE.md (**NEEDS
  RATIFICATION**). Meshing measured *faster* through the authority (0.93 vs 1.17
  ms/chunk — generate-once-and-memoize beats per-voxel S1 noise). Keys 3/4 (S1
  authority) unchanged; all 38 suites green. **Far mesh left on S1** (residue
  below) — sourcing coarse far rings from worldgen is renderer/storage-scale
  work, not cheap. **Walk-13 verified live** (journal/0018): unstreamed-edge
  collision (mid-air character spawn → landing at a never-streamed column),
  authoritative `eye_in_solid`, edits-included `surface:true` seating, and
  the first deep-time cut-face photographs (0018 assets — mudstone/basalt/
  olivine-speckled granite at outcrop scale).

- 2026-07-19 — Body staircase step 3 (journal/0014, walk 11, merge
  `f0e9f2d`): trunk-follows-travel / head-follows-look via the neck
  (walk-8 orientation gap closed, photographically verified thanks to
  the new v0 brow face cue); two-bone leg IK with stepped output and
  half-voxel offset cap; parametric crouch split exactly on the firewall
  (`dc:character/set_posture`, 0.6× collider, stand-up guard,
  PostureBlocked receipt; procedural pose cosmetic-side); posture replay
  bit-identity proven.

- 2026-07-19 — S9b parallelism spike (journal/0013, merge `9910c45`):
  the determinism tax measured — flood has no byte-identical parallel
  form (98.5% serial floor at B); deterministic-parallel phases 1.2×
  whole-step, bandwidth-saturated by 8 threads; **A+C confirmed**,
  corrections #9 (S9's 2-minute flip condition falsified on ≤12-thread
  hardware; reopenable via deeptime_par --full-b elsewhere). Scatter→
  gather diffusion reformulation, byte-identity proven scalar-vs-parallel.

- 2026-07-19 — S9 deep-time spike (journal/0012, merge `3fd00bb`): the
  spike era reopens and pays off — two-plane erosion + measurement-tagged
  strata recorder + orographic march, additive in dc-worldgen. A/B/C
  measured (A 14 s; B ~63 min/~3 GiB scalar — corrections #8; C region
  refinement 3.6 s); decay length 21 cells (hillslope), drainage the sole
  advect; 500 m columns already tell true stories. Verdict: A+C unless
  parallelism flips B (S9b decides). Integration fought and won a
  stale-worktree env!-path bomb in the parity tests (corrections #7).

- 2026-07-18 — Repo, architecture, CI (3-OS), five-crate workspace.
- 2026-07-18 — S1 voxel scale (N=2 decided) · S2 constraint ledger (GO) ·
  S3 chunk format v1 + LOD + far mesh · S4 Forward+ + shader packs ·
  S5 dc-api parity (wasm/MCP/native) · S7 worldgen pregen + lazy pyramid +
  year-zero handoff · S8 materials storage (GO, free-form mixtures).
- 2026-07-18 — Rendering fixes from walk 2: spawn-frame flash, LOD z-fight.
- 2026-07-18 — S6 physics bubble: dc-physics (rapier3d 0.34 direct,
  enhanced-determinism), 4³-voxel collider tiles with set-difference refresh,
  bit-identical replay, detach→settle→reattach via the 24 integer lattice
  rotations, G-key client demo. **Spike era closed: all eight spikes shipped.**
- 2026-07-18 — Client through dc-api + observability harness (journal/0002):
  HostWorld embedded as the client's edit authority (pluggable generator over
  the S1 TerrainGen; ChunkMap demoted to receipt-driven cache); LMB/RMB edits
  as player-class `dc:world/set_block` commands (dc-core DDA raycast,
  crosshair + target gizmo); edit→remesh dirty sets + S6 collider-tile
  invalidation wired; in-client MCP over streamable HTTP :7777 (registry-
  generated tools shared with dc-mcp-dev + client_screenshot to
  journal/assets + player pose get/set); direct/MCP-layer/HTTP-wire edit
  parity proven headless.

- 2026-07-18 — First agent self-walk (journal/0003): MCP session against the
  running game — pose/scan/edit/screenshot loop proven; six findings filed
  to Observed. The practice is established.

- 2026-07-18 — Walk-3 corrections + walker proprioception (journal/0004,
  `0ba292f`): three of four walk-3 "renderer defects" were camera-inside-
  block misdiagnoses (corrections.md #3); shipped eye_in_solid, surface-
  clamped teleport, pitch docs, open-ground spawn; MCP edit pipeline
  photographically verified.

- 2026-07-19 — 3d: geology post-v1 slice (journal/0011, walk 10, merge
  `ba666e6`): igneous fitness weather-blind (per-class contracts —
  corrections #6: the seam's real quantizer was the chunk-column collapse
  unit, not cell-stepped climate); member-contact boundary dither
  (data-proven wandering contacts); two-layer class-satisfiability
  enforcement with named culprits; olivine pore-partial inclusions
  (photographed, assets 0011-*); roster proof 17→22 materials, 10 vanilla
  members across 6 classes.

- 2026-07-19 — 3c-2: material-tier geology visible (journal/0010, walk 9,
  merge `8c9f67f`): registry albedos on all 17 materials; sidecar channel
  through the seam (order-dependent MixtureTable ids resolved to a
  render-only ContentsGrid at the generator boundary — no intern id
  crosses the lock); 4×4 world-anchored deterministic dither on mixed
  faces (subtle ore with zero ore-specific code); partial-height loose
  rendering built-but-dormant. First mixture photographs from a placer
  cut 60 km out (assets 0010-*); `examples/river_cells.rs` dev tool born
  of the hunt.

- 2026-07-19 — Body staircase steps 1–2 (journal/0009, walk 8, merge
  `dd9b802`): body plans + anim clips as namespace-owned registry data
  (fourth roles-as-contracts instance; clips standalone-before-plan, flagged
  in API.md); the 11-segment `dc:body/biped` replacing the two-cuboid
  companion; stepped 12 fps sampler (32-step rotations, 5 mm bob — the bob
  quantization also fixed a ULP loop-wrap divergence), crossfade idle↔walk,
  verb→anim-slot contract enforced at define time. Walk-photographed
  standing and mid-stride (assets 0009-*).

- 2026-07-19 — Placeholder LabPBR texture packs (merge `78e9d95`, asset-
  only): 21 deterministic 16×16 three-texture sets generated from the
  property sheets; seamless tiling verified after user query and now
  asserted by the generator's self-check (`ea7251d`).

- 2026-07-19 — 3c-1: geology walkable at block tier (journal/0008, walk 7,
  merge `ee639f9`): dc-worldgen through the client seam (PregenSource
  Arc-opening, Rc→Arc caches, one Mutex two worlds — seam-level order-
  independence proven); Mudstone/Sandstone/Granite/Basalt blocks; N=2 boot
  restored (scale keys ratified: 2 = worldgen, 3/4 = legacy S1 dev
  affordance); surface machinery authority-aware; freeze-on-disconnect
  (Drop-fires-once → zero-intent command on the receipted rail), proven
  live mid-stride in walk 7. First geology photographs: quarry cut showing
  granite → basalt → mudstone → soil (assets 0008-*).

- 2026-07-19 — Geology v1 backbone (journal/0007, merge `1df2666`): content-
  class registry (classes-as-contracts; the Payload opening as open keys
  over a closed value vocabulary — NEEDS RATIFICATION with the class-sheet
  fields and pass vocabulary, marked in API.md); pass graph with
  creator/modifier/reader semantics replacing `Pregen::run` (output-
  preserving, S7 byte-identity unchanged); strata recording with climate-
  at-deposition tags; clastic/igneous/placer passes (placer from property-
  derived settle energies — gold-dust lands mid-gravel with zero
  ore-specific code); registration-order independence proven as fingerprint
  equality; perf cost is noise (cold chunk 0.711 ms mean post-geology).

- 2026-07-19 — Surface-truth fix + attach guard (journal/0006, walk 6): the
  walks-3–5 "under-report" diagnosed and closed — analytic field vs its own
  voxelization (½-voxel top-face offset) compounded by footprint-over-slope
  (14.49 m worst; 61% of columns would embed a body). `true_surface_m`
  (footprint-max per-column voxel scan, edits included) now seats spawn,
  `surface:true` teleport, and character attach; embed-guarded attach with
  `obstructed` receipt + opt-in surface-snap; photographically verified at
  the measured worst case. Corrections #5 (the "missing octave" story).

- 2026-07-19 — Bodies/sockets design doc (docs/design/bodies.md), Sequenced
  3b: body plans as registry contracts (anims bind to the plan; fork
  inherits by retained joints; verb→anim-slot validated at define time),
  the animation-is-cosmetic determinism firewall (sim sees parametric
  posture states only), IK as retargeting glue, 12 fps stepped-animation
  aesthetic, clothing as segment-copy shells — all ratified 2026-07-19;
  sockets/transmog mechanics remain PROPOSED.

- 2026-07-19 — Character MCP surface (journal/0005): the second surface from
  API.md § Characters, embodied sessions on :7778. Character primitive in
  dc-api (named body, host-tick swept-AABB stepping, controller verbs as
  commands, diegetic pose/raycast/surroundings senses, all schema-
  registered); `Grant::CharacterControl` with attenuate-to-one-character
  sessions (cage proven at capability/host/HTTP layers; dev surface keeps
  full reach incl. any-character control); two-cuboid companion rendering;
  bit-identical scripted-session replay. Walk: companion attached, driven,
  sensed, photographed standing/walking/jumping (assets 0005-*) — and it
  walked off a cliff, which is the feature.

## In flight

- 2026-07-20 — **S11 — water locality + body-graph spike** (background agent,
  worktree; design in docs/design/water.md). Tests the "persist bodies,
  derive voxels" hypothesis against the two questions that broke the
  derive-everything model: is the bound-water relaxation genuinely local
  (halo size), and does the free-water body graph stay sparse under
  adversarial digging? Headless cost-and-locality measurement only — no
  renderer water, no deep-time changes. Scenarios include ocean-scale
  breach (a sea must not drain). Agent recommends GO/NO-GO; verdict is the
  user's.

*(**Organic materials + the biotic production flip: SHIPPED** 2026-07-20,
journal/0026 — see Shipped. Biology is on in every new world and the 24 m seam
is diggable.)*

*(**S10 biotic-layer spike: SHIPPED** 2026-07-20, journal/0025 — see Shipped.
**GO RATIFIED 2026-07-20** (user): the 25 s ritual is acceptable —
world-generation time is explicitly **not** a constraint we optimize against
(the user's frame: Dwarf Fortress takes minutes; full history will take
longer), and the answer to gen cost is the ready-made-worlds direction
(ideas.md), not a cheaper simulation. Roster constants + signal densities
ride as-built; § 5 fork 2 remains open and the user's.)*

*(Session-2 close state: the day shipped and walk-verified SIX integrated
milestones — S1-fallback sweep 0017, PBR-1 0019, render polish 0020,
instrument batch 0021, far-field horizon 0022 + hole fix, lit-mixture
amplitude-by-rarity — plus walks 13-18 and the Voxy/DH research doc. Main
green, 38 suites. After FF2a: S10, then 3e-2 implementation. Water-model
design doc open as conversation.)*

## Sequenced

*(**FF2a — voxel-language far field: SHIPPED** 2026-07-19, journal/0023 — see
Shipped. Stepped columns retired the smooth TIN; step 0 empirically confirmed
Bevy 0.19's GPU-driven multidraw engages for our custom material
(`mode=Culling`, 74 draws → 1 multidraw set); the buried-sheet and tile-crack
field reports are resolved, below.)* **FF2b — coarse volumetric
summaries** paired with the caves/underground thread of the water design
pass (when overhangs exist, the summary goes 3D; couples to S3 region
storage). FF2a left the extension point ready: the per-column payload is a
`ColumnSpan` the mesher already treats as one of a potential stack, and the
tile mesher is a pure function of plain span data (async-meshing / persistent
edit-tracked LOD store stay drop-in).


**Erodibility coupling — lithology-aware erosion** (DECIDED 2026-07-20,
user: "sequence erodibility first"; diagnoses the *dismal mountains*
finding in Observed). **The gap**: `erosion.rs` incises bedrock with a
single global `k_bedrock` — granite and mudstone erode identically, so the
world has **no differential erosion anywhere**, and differential erosion is
where nearly all landform drama comes from (hard beds → cliffs, ridges,
caprock; soft beds → slopes and benches). The only spatial resistance term
today is S10's biotic `resist`, and it only damps hillslope diffusion.
Long-standing filed open question in geology.md ("hardness→erodibility
coupling") — identified, never taken.

**The data already exists**: erosion runs per deep cell, and the recorder
already knows which unit is exposed at each cell's surface each epoch.
Erosion simply never asks. The milestone is to modulate incision (and
plausibly hillslope diffusivity) by a property-sheet-derived erodibility of
the exposed material.

Design notes for whoever takes it:
- **Feedback is the point, and the risk**: differential erosion is
  self-reinforcing (erode soft rock → expose hard rock → erosion slows).
  That is geologically correct and is what carves benches; it also wants a
  stability check so a cell cannot oscillate or stall pathologically.
- **Composition with the biotic terms** must be deliberate — `resist`
  (root cohesion, diffusion) and `wmult` (biotic weathering) already
  modulate erosion. State the composition order rather than letting it
  fall out.
- **Basement is hard by nature**: when a column is stripped past its
  record to bedrock, the exposed material is basement igneous/metamorphic.
  Coupling erodibility should therefore produce resistant shield/craton
  landscapes for free — a good falsifiable prediction to check.
- **Off-by-default first, like S10's `biotic`**: the abiotic/uncoupled path
  must stay byte-identical so the change is provable, and flipping it on
  changes `DeepField` for every new world (same class of event as the
  biotic flip).
- Deliverable should include **before/after cross-section and silhouette
  photographs** — this is an appearance change and the user ratifies looks
  from images.

**Far-field range knobs** (user-requested 2026-07-20 at the FF2a
ratification): expose the draw-distance geometry as adjustable settings —
`FULL_DETAIL_RADIUS_M`, the ring edges, `FAR_MAX_M` (today compile-time
constants in farmesh.rs) — so the user can push the horizon and feel the
FF2a scale-checkpoint numbers (~10 km ≈ 376 tiles / ~43 MiB, meshing stays
budget-bounded) instead of reading them. Small; a dev-console/config
surface question more than a rendering one; the ring-membership hysteresis
and coverage tests must hold at any setting.

**PBR-2 — lit-world completion** *(priority raised 2026-07-20: the 0027
walk found excavation interiors and coal render black under the current
sun-plus-face-orientation model, so PBR-2's tonemap/HDR + shadows now gate
whether the underground is **lookable at**, not merely prettier. Darkness
target DECIDED same day — visuals.md: real darkness underground, reference
is modded Minecraft with shaders; the no-darkness lean is retired.)* (the deferred half of the renderer, opened by
PBR-1 shipping): sun **shadows** (Bevy cascades + our knobs, the chasm-shaft
signature shot), **colored point lights** (lava/forge/bioluminescence via Bevy's
clustered path), **tonemap/HDR** (`Camera::hdr` + exposure — real darkness and
earned firelight), **POM** (the LabPBR height channel is already packed),
**light shafts/godrays**, **water**, and **weather/wetness** coupling
(sim-driven porosity darkening — the specular B channel is already sampled).
The `opaque.terrain` shader-pack HOOK (PIPELINE.md § 5, format ≥ 1) also lands
here: PBR-1's material follows the § 5 texture + vertex-attribute contract but is
not yet runtime-overridable via a pack (needs a `HOOK_FORMAT` bump + prelude
composition, like the `post` stage). Never: GI (doctrine).

**S10 follow-through — the biotic layer's five open calls** *(the spike
itself SHIPPED 2026-07-20, journal/0025 + docs/spikes/S10-results.md; it
answered the gate question — all four signals present and legible, cost
+10 s once and +6 MiB kept. What remains is **user decisions**, and one
implementation slice.)*

**NEEDS RATIFICATION (user-owned, from S10-results.md § Recommendation):**
1. ~~**The world-creation ritual grows 15 s → 25 s (+66 %)**~~ — **RATIFIED
   2026-07-20, and the number was pessimistic**: measured on the shipped path
   the ritual is **13.79 s** (biology's marginal cost +2.6 s, not +10 s). The
   25 s figure came from the spike harness's *scalar* driver; production takes
   S9b's byte-identical parallel path — **corrections #12**, journal/0026.
2. ~~**Flipping `production_config`'s `biotic` to true**~~ — **DONE**
   2026-07-20 (journal/0026). Biology runs in every new world; the `DeepField`
   changed for every world created from here.
3. **Signal abundance is aesthetic, not correctness**: coal 0.55 % of
   columns, paleosols 22.9 %, charcoal 20.2 %, retrogression 23.5 %. Is a
   fifth of the world carrying a fire record the texture we want?
   *(Amended 2026-07-20, journal/0026 — the question is now narrower than it
   looked. Measured against the 0.9 m voxel, the **fire record is entirely
   invisible** to a player (0 of 158 310 beds survive quantization), so the
   "fifth of the world burning" texture does not reach the eye at all today.
   What DOES reach the eye is organic **soil**: 185 km of surviving thickness,
   making carbonaceous mudstone the second most abundant rock in cut faces.
   That, not charcoal, is the appearance call to make.)*
4. **The 7-species roster and ~25 rate constants** ride as
   plausible-not-tuned (no-bandaid: they are the mechanism's calibration,
   not a patch) — same status as S9's physics constants.
5. **Pack-addition blast radius** (ecology.md § 5 fork 2) **has stopped
   being hypothetical**: biology is now demonstrably an erosion term, so
   adding an organism pack would change *terrain*, which materials packs
   never did. The doc filed this as "needs deciding before biology couples
   to erosion" — it now does. Options unchanged: bake biotic erosion at
   world creation (pack-add affects ungenerated regions only, matching the
   DF-like seed policy) or accept landform drift.

*(**Collapse-tier organic materials + the production flip: SHIPPED**
2026-07-20, journal/0026 — see Shipped. The `Biofacies` → class routing is in,
coal/peat/carbonaceous-mudstone exist, and the 24 m seam at world voxel
(107338, 58787) is diggable. Two follow-ons fell out of it, both
measurement-backed:)*

**Charcoal as an inclusion, not a band** (journal/0026, measured): the fire
record is the third most numerous facies (158 310 beds) and **none of it
survives the collapse tier** — mean bed ~3.5 cm against a 0.9 m voxel, 0 of
158 310 kept. A charcoal *band* is therefore impossible at this voxel scale, so
no charcoal material was shipped. The honest representation is the one geology.md
§ inclusions already ratified: a few dark eighths riding inside the host stratum
above the burn, exactly as the placer puts gold in gravel and 3d puts olivine in
basalt. Blocked on a mechanism, not a decision — `deposit_deep_history` currently
*drops* sub-voxel units, so this needs a redistribute-into-host rule that touches
every dropped unit (mineral ones included) plus an inclusion channel on
`StrataEvent` distinct from the placer's `ore`. Its own slice, with its own
invariant work.

**Coal rank when burial deepens** (journal/0026): `dc:stratum/organic-coal`
ships one member because rank transitions (lignite → sub-bituminous →
bituminous → anthracite) live at ~1–2 km of burial and our deepest recorded
overburden is ~100 m — a rank ladder now would be a discriminator on an axis the
data never visits. The class's **depth axis is the rank axis** and the
class-share invariant means members can be added later without moving an
existing seam. Revisit when the record carries kilometres (3e-later / thicker
basins).

Also filed from S10 (not blocking): parent-material phosphorus from pregen
provenance instead of a uniform pool; individual plant placement from the
community vector by addressed hashing (ecology.md's derivation-chain
terminus — note the community vector is currently **dropped** after the run,
so C-refinement would have to re-derive it); vegetation → channel planform
("vegetation invented meandering rivers") needs 3e-2's finer corridor to
have any planform to bend.

**3e-2 — C refinement** (DECIDED 2026-07-19 — earth-processes.md § 3e-2
decisions — and implementable): drainage coarse-at-A with the
river-conditioning mechanism (corridor wander toward refined lows +
descent-along-flow as hard constraint, no divide-crossing); width cap
permanent; 0015-mechanism elevation stitch + interior-commit records over
the 16–24-cell halo; proximity approach trigger, order-independent by
construction; **contact-softening in scope per method rule 5** (no
grid/analytic boundary reaches the eye); calibration RATIFIED — the
Phanerozoic register (~500 Myr recorded span, basement ages procedural
— "procedural hacks for the boring billion"; knob deferred). **Nothing
open — implementable.**

**Water-model design pass** (ratified 2026-07-19, user; field-notebook
first per the earth-processes method): groundwater as "another dimension
for the flow to go" — water table / aquifers (S8 per-voxel porosity is
the waiting substrate), ponds and sub-resolution water (procedural-tricks
tail), visible/flowing water (couples to PBR-2 water), lakes/inland seas
already implicit as deep-tier flooded basins (spill levels known).
**Groundwater ↔ CAVES coupling flagged by the user** — speleogenesis as
the eventual cave story (today's caves are S1 noise carving). Design doc
before any code.

3a. Form archetypes + drop distributions (materials.md § forms) — implement
   with the first inventory/interaction milestone.
3c-2. Geology client integration, material tier (visuals DECIDED
   2026-07-19, visuals.md § mixture road): sidecar channel through the
   seam + interim world-anchored dither materialization (registry albedos,
   eighths-weighted), partial-height loose-material rendering with binary
   threshold collider; subtle ore. Runs after body steps 1–2. Watch the
   order-dependent MixtureTable ids at the seam (journal/0008). Data-driven
   block registry (API.md `define block_type`) supersedes the appended enum
   here or soon after.
3d. Geology post-v1 slice (geology.md §§ formation-context +
   roster/inclusions/slots, DECIDED 2026-07-19): strip climate windows from
   igneous class sheets (formation-context shim correction — fitness goes
   province/depth-driven); chunk-line family cutover diagnosis + smoothing
   (context interpolation / boundary dither); two-layer class-satisfiability
   enforcement in pipeline validation; accessory inclusions as pore
   partials; then the rich vanilla mineral roster. Carbonate follows.
3e. Epoch-indexed formation context (the deep-time turn): paleo-context
   axes from pregen history feeding deposition/metamorphism; igneous from
   tectonic setting + emplacement depth. Orogeny-repo recon 2026-07-19 as
   idea quarry; couples to S2 checkpoint-facts design (Observed).
4/5. **Ecology + organisms** — designed 2026-07-19, docs/design/ecology.md
   (supersedes the old biomes/ecology seeds and the agenda doc): species
   is the primitive, biome is a diagnosis; the six-process biotic layer on
   the deep-time tier; biology as an erosion/weathering/rock-forming term;
   a "biome pack" is an organism pack. Evolution recorded as the user's
   teleology design (org defs pin a form at a horizon; the lineage between
   is simulated; ahistorical override; fossils = mid-horizon pins) —
   post-v1, but v1 must not foreclose it.
   - *(**S10 biotic-layer spike — the gate — PASSED** 2026-07-20,
     journal/0025 + docs/spikes/S10-results.md: community vector + all six
     processes on the A-tier, all four read-quality signals present and
     legible, cost +10 s once / +6 MiB kept, determinism intact. Evolution
     stayed out of scope as specified. The substrate evolution will ride is
     proven; the five ratification calls are above.)*
6. Body plans implementation staircase (docs/design/bodies.md § staircase,
   ratified 2026-07-19) — six steps from joint-tree skeleton to authoring
   editor; not yet scheduled against the geology track.

## Observed (undiagnosed or deliberately unfixed)

- **"Our dismal mountains"** (user, 2026-07-20) — DIAGNOSED, four causes,
  all absences rather than bugs, which is why the terrain reads as flat in
  character rather than visibly broken:
  1. **Erosion is lithology-blind** (source-confirmed): one global
     `k_bedrock`, so no differential erosion exists anywhere. → now
     **Sequenced** as the erodibility-coupling milestone, user-ordered
     first.
  2. **No dip/fold** (the layer-cake item below): even differentiated beds
     would only give horizontal benches and mesas; **dipping** hard beds
     are what produce hogbacks, cuestas and flatirons. Second in the
     user's ordering; S9 already classified fold-phase as a cheap *relax*
     term.
  3. **Conservative amplitude / no voxel-scale cliffs** (filed since S7).
  4. **No glacial agent** — cirques, arêtes, horns and U-valleys are the
     most dramatic alpine landforms and we have no cryosphere. Explicitly
     LAST (geology.md already sequences glacial as "later"); it needs ice
     as a modelled agent.
  Causes 1 and 2 multiply: hardness contrast supplies *what* stands out,
  structural dip supplies *how* it stands out.


- **The world is a LAYER CAKE — no dip, no folding, no tilt** (user,
  2026-07-20, from reading walk cross-sections: "the seams have to match
  orientation properly if this was pushed up in a tectonic event,
  subducted, etc."). **Confirmed by source read**: the only structural
  feature implemented anywhere is `DepUnit::unconformity: bool`
  (recorder.rs). Strata are per-column stacks of thickness, so every layer
  in the world is horizontal regardless of the tectonic history that
  produced it — a seam thrust up by an orogeny lies as flat as one that
  never moved. earth-processes § 7 (structural deformation:
  fold/fault/unconformity) is DESIGNED but only the unconformity flag was
  built; S9 classified fold-phase as a *relax* term (`fold-phase =
  f(uplift)` at sample time), so the cheap path was identified and not
  taken. Lateral variation exists only because adjacent columns read
  different 460 m deep cells. **This matters disproportionately for a game
  about reading strata**: dipping beds, folds and truncations are how a
  cross-section tells you what happened to it. Undesigned; pairs with the
  3e structural-deformation work.

- **Thick units render as flawless monoliths** (user, 2026-07-20; general
  case, noticed as house-sized unbroken pure coal). Two mechanisms, both
  ours: deep-time epochs are ~2.5 Myr so parting-forming events are
  sub-epoch and invisible, and the recorder merges consecutive like epochs
  into one horizon (the 665 k → 71 k unit optimization). Real thick seams
  carry mineral partings; real rock generally carries defects. Fix belongs
  at the **collapse tier as procedural detail** (method rule 5), not in
  deep time. Sketches in ideas.md § rock is not monolithic and § coal
  partings; pairs with the filed-not-built charcoal-as-inclusion item.

- **Loose materials do not exist in the world yet** (user, 2026-07-20:
  "needed — even if they don't fall with gravity yet"). The RENDERER is
  already waiting: partial-height loose rendering shipped built-but-dormant
  in 3c-2 (journal/0010) because loose deposition never emits sub-8
  columns. Missing half is content/simulation. User direction for when it
  lands: loose materials should **spread on being dropped** (granularity +
  fall height → partials displaced into surrounding empties) — angle of
  repose from the partials model rather than a physics solver. Sketch in
  ideas.md.


- **The sim must know about light** (user, 2026-07-20; NEW thread, see
  visuals.md § open thread). Distinct from render-side lighting: a
  deterministic sim-side light field is wanted for (candidates)
  photosynthesis/plant growth, spawn behaviour, stealth/NPC vision. No
  prior existed in the corpus. Noted parallel: a propagated light field
  and water.md's bound-water saturation field are the same computational
  shape (bounded local relaxation attenuated by a per-material property),
  so S11's locality result may transfer. Undesigned.


- **No pooling/reuse of chunk or far-tile GPU resources** (user question,
  2026-07-20; read from source, not measured). Every chunk load
  `commands.spawn`s a fresh entity with `meshes.add(to_bevy_mesh(..))` — a
  newly allocated `Mesh` asset — and every unload `despawn()`s it, freeing
  the asset. Far tiles (`LoadedFarTile`) follow the same churn. Partly
  mitigated for free: Bevy's `MeshAllocator` slab-allocates vertex buffers
  (FF2a step 0 found our custom attributes only *select* a slab), and the
  ECS recycles entity ids — so the unmitigated cost is CPU-side `Vec` +
  `Mesh` asset churn on every chunk-boundary crossing. **Filed prior**:
  voxy-dh-recon transfer map already lists "persistently-mapped pooled
  vertex buffers (AZDO) → far-tile buffer management when tiles churn."
  **Unmeasured.** Per placeholder-state-is-not-intent, measure at the
  design-target scale (10 km field, hundreds of tiles churning while
  walking), not at today's 1.2 km — the far-field range knobs milestone is
  the natural vehicle for that measurement.

- **Walk report (2026-07-20, journal/0027): coal renders as pure black in the
  lit pass — a hole in the screen, not a rock.** Photographed at world voxel
  (-76133, -80221) on the client's world: an 18-voxel seam four voxels under
  turf, cut to an open bench under full sky. `0027-coal-seam-cut-lit.png` shows
  grass / mudstone / carbonaceous mudstone and then black for the lower
  two-thirds of the frame — including the **bench floor**, which is an up-facing
  sunlit surface, so this is not shadowing. **The fullbright control
  (`0027-coal-seam-cut-fullbright.png`) shows coal as an ordinary mid-dark grey**,
  so the block, the atlas and the 29-layer palette are all correct. Mechanism:
  `meshing.rs` gives `Block::Coal` a vertex colour of `[0.07, 0.065, 0.06]` —
  7 % linear, ≈ 0.29 sRGB, which is exactly what fullbright draws. The lit path
  multiplies that by the directional term and tonemaps, and 7 % albedo has
  nowhere to go but zero. **The number is physically right** (real coal is
  0.04–0.08) — the defect is that the lit path has **no floor under the dark
  end**, so a correct dark material becomes an absence of image. **Do not fix by
  brightening coal.** This is a lighting/tonemap question (an ambient/sky floor,
  or a tonemap that preserves shadow separation), and it belongs with PBR-2's
  shadow work. Second-order finding from the same walk: **vertical faces deep in
  an excavation receive essentially no light at all**
  (`0027-pit-interior-unlit-lit.png` — a bright green plain with a clean brown
  mudstone rim, and a black void four voxels below it), which is the same missing
  floor and makes any deep dig unphotographable and probably unplayable.

- **Walk report (2026-07-20, journal/0027): peat and carbonaceous mudstone are
  nearly the same colour.** `[0.24, 0.17, 0.11]` vs `[0.21, 0.18, 0.15]` — a
  difference you can measure and not really one you can see, and the fullbright
  control makes it worse rather than better (side by side and unlit they are
  nearly the same taupe; `0027-peat-coal-mudstone-section-fullbright.png`).
  Deliberately unfixed for now: peat is rare (17 cells world-wide on the seed
  walked), and the pair that actually matters — organic soil against ordinary
  mudstone — is well separated. Revisit when the placeholder texture packs are
  replaced with authored art, which is the right moment to space the organic
  materials across the palette on purpose.

- **Walk report (2026-07-20, journal/0027): the client can only ever open seed
  1337, so every seed-specific coordinate in the docs is unreachable in game.**
  `dc-client` takes no `--seed`; `app.rs` boots `Authority::new(BENCH_SEED, ..)`
  with `BENCH_SEED: i32 = 1337`, and the worldgen authority takes `seed as u64`
  — so `0x0D5E_ED57_2026` (the seed every spike and the whole S10/0026 site list
  is measured on) **does not fit in the client's `i32` seed** and world voxel
  (107338, 58787) is a headless-test address, not a place a player can stand.
  journal/0026's "stand at world voxel (107338, 58787) and dig down" is not
  actionable from the game. Cheap fix available (a `--seed` arg on the same
  path as `--pack`), not taken on a photo walk because it is client code and
  this walk changed none. Until then, walks must re-site their own subjects on
  seed 1337, which journal/0027 did.

- **User field report (2026-07-20, filed at the FF2a/0024 ratification): a
  razor-straight, kilometer-scale grass/dirt frontier cuts the far field**
  (visible in `0024-after-ne.png` / `0024-fb-ne.png`; present in fullbright,
  so it is surface-block DATA, not a seam or lighting). The user identifies
  this as **the original cause of the walk-8 complaint** — material families
  "appearing to change immediately across some kind of boundary" — now
  legible at full extent because the far field renders the surface rule at
  km scale: "obviously bad / not natural appearing." **DIAGNOSED
  2026-07-20 (read from source, not yet fixed)** — and it is NOT the
  quantization class this entry first guessed. `collapse.rs`
  `surface_sample`: `let bare = riverbed || precip < 0.10 || (fringe &&
  precip < 0.35)` — a **hard binary threshold on a very smooth field**.
  `climate_at` bilinearly interpolates precip between climate-cell centres,
  and a cell is `CELL_VOXELS` = 16 384 voxels ≈ **14.7 km** at N=2, so over
  any near-field view the field is essentially locally linear: its 0.10
  isoline is a geometrically straight line running for kilometres, and the
  threshold gives it **zero transition width**. Two independent defects
  (both must be fixed): (1) *no transition* — grass/dirt needs a
  probabilistic/fractional band around the threshold, not a step; (2) *no
  detail in the boundary itself* — even a soft edge would be a smooth
  km-scale arc, so the isoline wants domain warp / octave noise on precip
  (or on the threshold) to make the frontier wander at 10–100 m scale.
  The 3d member-contact dither is the material-tier precedent; surface
  BLOCK selection has no analogue. **Any fix must live inside
  `surface_sample`**, which near and far provably share (journal/0022), so
  the horizon heals with the ground. Related: walk-8 "material families cut
  hard on chunk lines" — the user identifies THIS as that complaint's
  origin (a different mechanism from the walk-10 per-chunk flow_energy
  rounding, which stays open separately). Couples to the biotic layer: the
  real cure may be that ground cover stops being a paint decision at all
  (see docs/design/ideas.md § the bio slot).

- *(**User field report (2026-07-20, post-FF2a): thin bright seams between far
  patches — RESOLVED** 2026-07-20, journal/0024, fix cycle, background agent;
  worktree branch for the integrator; gates green. Mechanism confirmed
  (corrections #11): the anti-z-fight push translated adjacent same-level tiles
  along their *own* center→viewer directions, differing by the tiles' angular
  separation, so mesh-space-watertight seams reopened at the TRANSFORM stage as
  0.08–0.9 m (L1→L4) world-space slots — see-through once the far field became a
  hollow top-surface sheet (0022/FF2a). Fix: **per-level UNIFORM push** — one
  shared vector per LOD level per frame, along the camera-forward axis, magnitude
  unchanged (`DEPTH_PUSH_FRAC × coarse voxel`). Every tile of a level undergoes
  the identical rigid translation, so shared edges cannot separate *by
  construction*; magnitude differs per level, so overlapping ring pairs still
  separate in the lap band (corrections #1 honored — a true world-space offset,
  never a bias). Applied to BOTH far paths (S1 chunks + FF2a tiles). World-space
  seam proof past the transform: `uniform_push_keeps_same_level_seams_watertight_in_world_space`
  (exact-zero shared-edge gap for a nasty off-axis high vantage; the retired
  radial scheme fails the same check). Walk-verified live (lit + fullbright, high
  vantage −45° yaw sweep): far field continuous, no bright light-through slivers
  anywhere; no z-fight at lap bands or the near/far boundary at grazing or
  top-down angles. Assets `0024-after-{ne,se}`, `0024-fb-ne`,
  `0024-fb-zfight-graze`, `0024-zfight-topdown`.)*

- *(**User field report: the far LOD sheet is buried under the near field —
  RESOLVED** 2026-07-19, FF2a journal/0023. Mechanism confirmed: the walk-17
  one-tile inner lap slid the L1 far sheet under the near field (from ~54 m),
  sunk half a coarse voxel — present but hidden, so digging exposed a phantom
  floor. Fix: **coverage logic, not buried geometry** — a far column the near
  volumetric field covers (`near_covers`, altitude-aware 3-D distance < 112 m)
  is CULLED, so a fully-covered tile meshes to *nothing*. Floor-quantized far
  tops (≤ near surface) let the near field win the thin [112, 128] m occluded
  overlap with no sink. Dig test photographed: only real near geology, no
  phantom floor (`0023-fb-dig-no-phantom-floor`); headless proof: fully-covered
  tile meshes empty.)*

- *(**User field report: clear pixel gaps between far-field tiles — RESOLVED**
  2026-07-19, FF2a journal/0023. The prediction held: voxelization cures the
  crack class **inherently**. Stepped prisms share face planes; a step's side
  face is emitted once by the taller column only, and a tile samples its
  neighbours' shared boundary columns, so same-level tile seams are watertight
  with no skirt (grazing-angle fullbright shot `0023-fb-grazing-horizon`: no
  cracks). Only differing-stride ring-to-ring edges and the near/far coverage
  boundary get a modest 2-coarse-voxel skirt — "skirt only what remains." The
  faint one-sided-normal stitch *lines* (cosmetic, haze-hidden) stay filed
  below, unchanged.)*

- **The Voxy-vs-Distant-Horizons thread** *(submission question DECIDED
  2026-07-19 session 3 — docs/design/voxy-dh-recon-2026-07-19.md
  § Addendum: far field rides Bevy 0.19's engine GPU-driven path on the
  one-shared-material `Mesh` substrate; vertex pulling/bespoke cmdgen
  rejected; packed quad survives only as a candidate storage format.
  **Step-0 CONFIRMED** 2026-07-19, FF2a journal/0023: the multidraw path
  engages for our custom material — live `mode=Culling`, `Opaque3d
  batches=74 sets=1` on Vulkan; custom vertex attributes don't disqualify
  batching. Substrate decision is real on this hardware.)*
  Still open from the doc: persistent edit-updated LOD store (summaries
  beside S3 region files, dirty-rail subscription — still owed; FF2a kept
  the mesher pure + the `ColumnSpan` payload persistence-shaped so it's a
  drop-in); Aokana SVDAG ray-march as the FF2b volumetric candidate. Vista-as-augury
  constraint stands (rendering is never an observer — binds when
  live-sim state becomes far-visible).

- Walk 17 (journal/0022 § walk 17 + § the holes were a partition): **far
  sheet parallelogram sky holes — RESOLVED** 2026-07-19 (fix cycle,
  worktree branch). Mechanism: a level's far tiles *partition* the ground
  plane (no overlap), so a point has exactly one tile per level; center-
  distance ring assignment let an inter-ring boundary cell be rejected by
  BOTH the finer ring (center past its outer edge) and the coarser ring
  (center short of its inner edge), punching a fixed-position sky hole with
  no fallback tile. NOT winding, NOT a missing index. Fix: each ring laps
  its inner edge one own-tile inward (`far_tile_in_ring`), restoring
  between-ring redundancy; the same lap under the near field also cured the
  **grazing-angle near/far slivers**. Headless proof:
  `far_tiles_cover_the_rings_without_seams` (88 463 uncovered points
  pre-fix → 0). Verified live hole-free at both walk-17 vantages + 3 yaw
  sweeps (fullbright). *(Phantom old world + empty horizon: RESOLVED
  earlier, verified at the 0018 framings.)* **Left filed:** faint
  tile-edge stitch lines (one-sided-normal seam) — cosmetic, haze-hidden;
  a cross-tile normal halo is deferred polish.


- Walk 16 (journal/0021 § walk 16): **the lit path erases low-fraction
  mixtures** — DIAGNOSED by same-framing lit/fullbright pair
  (0021-mixture-* assets): olivine wins whole cells in fullbright, zero
  pixels in lit; same splat attributes, so the heightlerp buries it
  (elevation = weight + texture height; a 1/8 accessory can't out-elevate
  a 7/8 host anywhere). Contradicts the ratified "grains poke through"
  intent. RESOLVED 2026-07-19: amplitude-by-rarity + jitter shipped and
  photographically verified (0021-*-v2 pair — olivine visible lit,
  statistical agreement with fullbright; amp constant is the tuning knob
  if ore should read louder). Cell quantization was rejected (grids shear
  authored features). Residual note:
  the houndstooth fix's narrowed albedo spread (0.17→0.11) reduced
  constituent contrast in the lit path generally.

- Walk 14 (journal/0019 § walk 14): *(fullbright lost the mixture speckle:
  **RESOLVED by PBR-1 render polish**, journal/0020 — a `FullbrightTerrainMaterial`
  (unlit custom `Material`) now renders uniform/block faces as one flat registry
  albedo and mixed faces as the world-anchored 4×4-cell constituent speckle,
  computed shader-side from the splat attributes + a world-anchored cell hash +
  the albedo palette uniform, NOT the LabPBR textures. Zero mosaic geometry.
  Live-verified: uniform spawn strata read flat under fullbright, both shaders
  compile/render error-free. **In-world speckle photograph still owed** — needs a
  real mixed face.)* **Member-contact + placer closeup shots owed** — not
  findable by eye under ground cover; wants the pregen-introspection dev MCP tools
  (walk-9 Observed item). The fullbright speckle photo rides with them (same
  scan-guided-site problem).

- **Placeholder texture tiling: cleanup pass DONE** (journal/0020, PBR-1 render
  polish). The walk-14 "houndstooth" was diagnosed as **legible per-voxel
  repetition of a low-frequency directional texture signature, NOT a seam
  failure** — the tiles wrap (the generator's `_seam_check` is still green;
  offline 4×4 tiling shows no boundary discontinuity), so the "seamless tiling
  verified" claim is **not** falsified (no corrections.md entry). Two mechanisms
  shipped: (1) **world-anchored UVs** in the mesher (tile origin = world voxel
  coord — continuous across same-material blocks and greedy quads, and the source
  of the fullbright speckle's world-stable cell grid; near visually-neutral in the
  lit path on its own for the current seamless tiles); (2) **de-directionalized
  placeholder textures** (`gen_placeholder_textures.py`: freq floor 2→4 + a
  three-octave fractal weighted to high frequency, albedo spread 0.17→0.11, relief
  2.6→1.5, softer AO ramp — regenerated all 26 packs, seam self-check still green)
  — this is the mechanism that actually removes the visible artifact. Live spawn
  (grass/dirt) reads as isotropic pixel grain with no legible period. **Geology
  outcrop before/after at the walk-14 framing still owed to the milestone walk.**

- PBR-1 loose ends (journal/0019):
  - **Terrain lighting is hand-rolled** (directional sun + hemispherical
    ambient from a plain uniform, not Bevy's clustered path — PBR-1 has no point
    lights). Sun/ambient calibration photographed in walk 14 (0019 assets:
    lit-vista, textured-outcrop — no top-face blowout at this calibration);
    **user read owed for the SPLAT_N=4 + calibration ratification**; the
    real curve arrives with PBR-2's HDR + tonemap.
  - **Far field + legacy S1 are now textured too** (one material renders the
    whole lit world). *(The phantom-far-world it painted is **gone** under the
    worldgen authority — journal/0022's summary-shaped far field; the same
    terrain material now lights the horizon that lights the ground.)*
  - **Normal-map tangent frame is a per-face axis-aligned approximation**; the
    normal X/Y orientation may be inconsistent across the six faces (cosmetic on
    the subtle placeholder relief). Revisit with authored textures + POM (PBR-2).
  - **The 16×16 atlas has no mipmaps** (nearest, no mip) — distance aliasing on
    the far rings; accepted for placeholder, revisit with real textures/POM.
  - **World-anchored UVs are f32 world voxel coordinates** (journal/0020) —
    integer at corners, so tiles resolve exactly to ~±16 M voxels and acceptably
    across the playable range; extreme deep-time coordinates would eventually lose
    texel precision. Accepted (the far field, the other extreme-coordinate
    consumer, is a known defect). One tile per *current-scale* voxel, so far-mesh
    coarse voxels still stretch a single tile — subsumed with the summary-shaped
    far field.
  - **Embedded WGSL shaders are compiled by naga at pipeline-build time** — no CPU
    gate (`fmt`/`clippy`/tests) sees them (journal/0020: a `active` reserved-word
    typo passed every gate and would have blanked fullbright; caught only by the
    live smoke run). The live launch + log read is the shader's only compiler;
    keep it in the walk protocol for any shader change.
  - Specular **porosity/emission channels are sampled but wetness is not wired**
    (no weather → no sim-driven porosity darkening yet; PBR-2 + materials sim).
  - Placeholder packs widened **21 → 26**; the historical placeholder-textures
    Shipped line still reads "21 deterministic packs" (not amended — dated
    record).
  - `MeshData` now carries UV + splat attributes on **every** chunk (far field
    and benches included), a small per-vertex memory bump over block-only meshes;
    accepted (the far field is getting subsumed anyway).

- **Walk 12's "blocking regression" was a misdiagnosis** (corrections #10,
  journal/0016): a pose in meters cross-checked against block queries in
  voxels. `true_surface_m` was already deep-time-aware (its ceiling reads
  `ColumnRec`). The investigation still paid: `eye_in_solid` was answering
  from the legacy S1 world on any ChunkMap miss, and a failed surface scan
  silently returned `analytic − 220 m`. Both fixed (merge `81a87b8`;
  `Option`-typed misses, authoritative solidity).
- **Instrument fix: pose replies echo the voxel coordinate — DONE**
  (journal/0021, instrument batch, awaiting integration). `client_player_pose_
  {get,set}` and `dc:character/pose` now carry `pos_voxel` (feet, active-scale
  voxels via the authority's own `scale.voxel_at`) beside the meters `pos` —
  the walker's two languages both labelled, no mental unit conversion (the
  corrections #10 misread that cost a full agent cycle).
- *(**Far mesh generated from S1 `TerrainGen` under the worldgen authority:
  RESOLVED** — journal/0022, the far-field horizon. Key 2 now samples the
  authority's OWN coarse surface (`WorldGenerator::coarse_surface`, the collapse
  kernel at a coarse stride — the lattice already folds in the deep-time surface)
  into a heightfield far field; the phantom old world ~1 km down is gone and there
  is a horizon. Keys 3/4 keep the S1 far mesh (`FarFieldTerrain`), which was never
  wrong for the S1 world. **Still open**: sealing `TerrainGen` behind
  `pub(in crate::authority)` — keys 3/4 still name it, so the seal waits on
  retiring S1 entirely, not on the far field. **Deferred by design** (journal/0022,
  noted here): (a) *persisted* summaries — the far field derives in-memory on
  demand this milestone (~0.22 s/full field), region-file storage couples to S3
  grouping and is the follow-on; (b) the heightfield is a **top surface**, so
  looking up from deep in a chasm loses the far field — the volumetric shell did
  extend down a chasm; a volumetric/skirted summary is the follow-on.)*
- Walk 12 residue: *(far-mesh visual assessment: DONE, walk 13 —
  journal/0018 § the empty horizon: at worldgen altitude the horizon is
  sky; the S1 phantom shows only from steep angles through haze. The
  far-field milestone is "build the horizon", not "fix the phantom".)*
  Still open: test-suite time +~6 min (deep-time on every Medium/Large
  pregen — wants a cost-insensitive fast path); Large extent runs a
  coarsened (~1.8 km) deep cell under the width cap until 3e-2's C
  refinement restores landform detail on approach.

- Walk 13 (journal/0018): *(**`surface_snapped` absent on the `surface:true`
  success path: RESOLVED** — journal/0021, instrument batch. The flag is now
  ALWAYS present in a `surface:true` reply: true when the scan seated the feet,
  false on a miss (position left as requested, `surface_error` string). Both
  paths leave through one `surface_teleport_reply` helper, so the flag can't be
  set on only one branch again.)*

- Walk 11 + step-3 loose ends (journal/0014): *(crouch factor: DECIDED
  2026-07-19, bodies.md § Crouch semantics — 0.6× stands; crouch is
  posture + the future sneak edge-walk-block verb, never crawlspace
  access; sub-standing clearances belong to prone/crawl, sketched in
  ideas.md § posture ladder.)* Max-bend leg fold reads
  tangled — knee pole/fold distribution wants a photo-driven tuning
  pass. *(Posture not exposed in `character_pose`: **RESOLVED** — journal/0021,
  instrument batch; the pose reply now carries `posture` in `set_posture`'s own
  `standing`/`crouching` vocabulary, so a readback round-trips into a command.)*
  Foot-IK ground read can momentarily see the S1
  far-mesh phantom at the extreme load-radius edge.

- Walk 5 (journal/0005, character surface): characters have **no auto
  step-up** — a one-voxel rise halts a grounded walker until it jumps
  *(DECIDED 2026-07-19: stays jump-required; mover-feature vs
  controller-skill is the NPC-intelligence design's question)*.
  *(Disconnect policy: DECIDED 2026-07-19 — freeze for v1, NPC-tier
  degradation as a later controller binding; API.md § Characters,
  bodies.md formerly-open Q3. Attach placement guard: fixed,
  journal/0006.)*

- Geology v1 loose ends (journal/0007): sea-floor/wilds columns keep empty
  strata records (subaqueous sedimentation = the carbonate milestone); no
  `def_changed` events for class/member defines (hot-reload signal; the
  events schema still enumerates only the original three kinds); dev-token
  `dc:*` grant *(DECIDED 2026-07-19, API.md § Capabilities: dev builds
  yes, shipped builds never — build-config gated; implementation owed)*;
  worldgen `MixtureTable` is per-generator,
  unbounded, and its ids are generation-order-dependent — a save layer must
  persist the table, never re-derive it (lifecycle belongs to region-file
  grouping, S3 OQ 7).

- Walk 10 + 3d loose ends (journal/0011): *(member identity is
  render-invisible: **RESOLVED by PBR-1**, journal/0019 — uniform-contents
  voxels now sample their material atlas layer, so siltstone renders
  differently from mudstone; the 3d contact smoothing is now visible. Walk
  confirmation owed with the PBR-1 milestone walk.)* **Class-presence
  quantization still cuts on chunk lines** (flow_energy rounding
  per-chunk) — most likely what walk 8 actually saw; needs per-voxel-
  column context. Igneous tectonic-setting fitness axis deferred to 3e.
  Olivine albedo reads close to grass green from afar — registry-data
  polish with the real texture milestone. Accessory gate/pore-fraction
  values picked, not tuned.

- Walk 9 + 3c-2 loose ends (journal/0010): dither cell count (4×4) and
  the resolve-at-boundary sidecar transport accepted as-built (integrator
  review 2026-07-19, per the no-bandaid razor). Far field and the
  legacy S1 authority render no dither (near-field worldgen only).
  Partial-height rendering is dormant until loose deposition emits sub-8
  columns; edits don't update materials (safe via the block gate).
  Mixed-heavy meshing worst case 16× triangles (real placer bands are
  thin). The walk wants **pregen introspection as dev MCP tools**
  (hydrology/province queries) instead of a side-channel example binary.
  Coarse clastic is rare at world scale (5 river segments on the Medium
  seed) — honest sedimentology vs knob, revisit when rivers refine.

- Walk 8 + user live observations (journal/0009): **nobody owns body
  orientation** — `SetMoveIntent` never touches yaw, `SetLook` is the only
  writer, so un-looked bodies strafe/moonwalk; v0 fix is a design call
  (renderer-side trunk-toward-velocity, cosmetic, vs controller
  convention), real answer is staircase step 3's trunk/look split.
  **Faceless heads make orientation unphotographable** — a face cue
  (texture or v0 asymmetry) is prerequisite to walk-verifying facing.
  **Material families cut hard on chunk lines** — candidate mechanism: at
  N=2 the chunk (28.8 m) equals the S7 column-quantization cell, so
  cell-stepped climate context flips selection exactly on chunk borders;
  diagnosis + smoothing (context interpolation / boundary dither) filed.
  **Third-person view** needed eventually to verify the player's own body
  (dev affordance; not slated). `jump` remains a fallback pose, not an
  authored clip. Plans/clips are define-only (no get/list queries yet).

- Walk 7 loose ends (journal/0008): **unloaded-neighbour and far-mesh
  fallbacks still sample S1 `TerrainGen`** — near-field loaded chunks are
  worldgen, but the far LOD rings and load-radius border faces show the old
  hill-field; user-sighted in walk 8 as a *phantom old world ~500 m below*
  the real terrain that dissolves on approach. A visible artifact until the
  far field becomes worldgen/summary-shaped (pairs with the existing
  far-mesh Observed items). Single-material
  faces under fullbright are featureless color fields — information arrives
  with the 3c-2 dither and later the splat pipeline. The `Terrain` resource
  is retained solely as the 3/4-key legacy fallback. *(Scale-3 boot default:
  fixed in 3c-1; freeze wire-drop path: proven live in walk 7.)*

- Walk 6 loose ends (journal/0006): the surface scan window is
  S1-terrain-sized (8 m headroom / 220 m depth) — structures stacked >8 m
  above the analytic surface won't be snapped to; revisit when worldgen
  amplitude grows. `find_open_spawn` uses terrain-only solidity — correct
  at startup, wrong if ever reused post-edits. Dev `spawn_character` stays
  unguarded (dev keeps full reach) — *ratified 2026-07-19 along with
  `surface:true` attach semantics (API.md § Characters records it; this
  line was stale until the 2nd-session doc sweep).*

- Walks 3–4 (journal/0003, 0004 — corrected record in corrections.md #3,
  #5): near-field lighting blows out pale top faces (flat shading +
  near-vertical sun + no tonemap shoulder) — art calibration, belongs to
  the visuals pass. Chasm cliff "speckle" now photographed from verified
  clean air (0006 asset): reads as genuine single-voxel terracing on the
  near-vertical carve, not a mesh defect — diagnosis still owed.
  *(`surface_height_m` under-report: diagnosed and fixed, journal/0006 —
  the "missing octave" hypothesis falsified, corrections #5.)*

- The embedded HostWorld never evicts chunks (~64 KiB per chunk ever
  streamed/edited); never-edited chunks are pure generator output and could
  be dropped freely (journal/0002).
- Far field doesn't see edits — the worldgen far field is a coarse *summary*
  (not a cache), so a broken block un-breaks beyond the full-detail radius; a
  summary that tracks edits is a follow-on (journal/0002, 0022). (Same for the
  S1 far mesh on keys 3/4.)
- Edits don't survive a 2/3/4 scale switch (authority rebuilt); the command
  log is the eventual persistence answer (journal/0002).
- *(**~2/3 of far-mesh triangles were sealed cave surfaces (S3): RESOLVED for
  the worldgen far field** — journal/0022. The worldgen horizon is a **top-surface
  heightfield** (2048 tris/tile, no interiors), not a volumetric shell. The S1 far
  mesh on keys 3/4 is unchanged / still volumetric.)*
- Far meshing is main-thread, budgeted (S1/S3, and the worldgen heightfield) —
  wants async tasks (journal/0022 keeps it budgeted/incremental).
- Rivers are straight cell-chords (S7); course refinement needs the 2-ring
  argument re-proved at finer levels.
- Terrain amplitude conservative — no voxel-scale cliffs (S7).
- Site cap 240 (u8 RegionId) — concrete instance of S2's ledger-scale
  question (S7).
- Sparse sidecar encoding for thin debris drapes (S8) — index array dominates.
- Seed-stable worlds across releases: versioning policy undecided (S7).
- HDR/exposure: v0 post grades LDR; sky-as-pass needs hook format 1 (S4).
- S2 checkpoint facts (deep-time re-derivation cost) — design owed before
  ledgers densify.
